  <p>QR Secure Scanner ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your information.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Play Services:</strong> Required for installation, updates, and in-app purchases.</li>
